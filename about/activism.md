###### 
**All Gender Restrooms** 
Prism has been working to get appropriate sinage on existing all gender bathrooms across campus, and to create more multi-stall all gender restrooms across campus. Our current bathroom project is to create an updated map of all restrooms across campus. 
**Gender Inclusive Housing**
Prism has been working with the Office of Residnce Life to help them improve their policies for transgender and gender non-conforming students living on campus. Our current project is to help facilitate the creation of a gender inclusive floor in MSV, with all gender restrooms. 
**Getting Involved**
Prism is always looking for more projects to take on. If you're experiencing any issues related to gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation on campus, please let us know and we will do all we can to fix the issue. If you want to get involved with our ongoing projects, send us an email or drop by a general body meeting.
